## Introduction
The World Happiness Report is a publication that contains articles and rankings of national happiness, based on respondent ratings of their own lives, which the report also correlates with various (quality of) life factors.

The pandemic brought not only pain and suffering but also an increase in social support and benevolence. As we battle the ills of disease and war, it is essential to remember the universal desire for happiness and the capacity of individuals to rally to each otherâ€™s support in times of great need.

In this project we are analysing the World Happiness Reports from 2019 up to 2022. The aim is to identify the happy places in the world and the impact of different factors on the happiness score.

For this, we are creating a dashboard with interactive graphs and maps for the selected years.
